  <h1><center>Overall Work Experience</center></h1>
  <br>
  <h5 style="margin:10px 20px 10px 20px">Since the year of 2016, I have worked in various law firms and in-house legal and compliance departments. My previous work experience and academic background (with the focus in international law, criminology, psychology, politics and human rights) have proven that I have extensive experience in using research databases, such as LexisNexis Library and Thomson Reuters Westlaw, as well as statistical software, such as IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), to conduct legal, social sciences and policy researches, analyze qualitative and quantitative data, draft briefing materials, memos and reports, and identify solutions to the partners and the major stakeholders in the firm. Also, I have excellent research and drafting skills, including the ability to assimilate and summarise large volumes of materials, to explore  different legal solutions available and provide the respective merits of each to the partners and the major stakeholders in the firm, and to produce high-quality work to meet tight deadlines. </h5>

<h5 style="margin:10px 20px 10px 20px">I received my Bachelor of Social Sciences in Criminology (Honours) at City University of Hong Kong in 2016.
<br><br>Throughout my bachelor’s degree, I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity and have spent three semesters studying abroad at three different universities in the United States as an exchange student. I was a Summer Exchange Student in Psychology and Politics at New York University during the summer semester of 2013. Two years later, I was a Summer Exchange Student in Human Rights and International Law at Stanford University during the summer semester of 2015. During the spring semester of 2016, I was awarded City University of Hong Kong College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences Exchange Scholarship to study at University of Texas at Dallas as an Exchange Student in Criminology.
<br><br>My rigorous undergraduate course of study, in both criminology and psychology, sparked my interest in law. In 2018, I obtained my Bachelor of Laws (LLB) (Honours) at University of Leeds, which I was awarded University of Leeds School of Law Merit Scholarship.
<br><br>In April 2020, I was awarded University of Sussex School of Law, Politics and Sociology Postgraduate Scholarship to undertake Master of Arts (Honours) in Corruption and Governance at University of Sussex from 01 September 2020. This master’s degree will be delivered and completed online at my own pace and would not disrupt my full-time work. Undertaking this master’s degree will extend my knowledge on the subject of corruption, governance, compliance in International Business and International Actors and Anti-Corruption.
